# VSCarbon

Encourage low-carbon coding habits with real-time electricity grid data! VSCarbon shows you when the electricity grid has lower carbon intensity, helping you time energy-intensive tasks.

**Make your coding greener, one commit at a time! 🌱**

## Features

✅ **Real-time Carbon Intensity**: Status bar displays current carbon intensity from the UK electricity grid  
✅ **Location-based Data**: Enter your UK postcode for regional carbon intensity data  
✅ **Visual Indicators**: Emoji changes based on carbon levels (😸 for low, 😿 for high)  
✅ **Commit Tracker**: Count sustainable git commits  
✅ **Dashboard**: Click status bar to see detailed grid mix and commit stats  
🔄 **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 minutes to keep data current

## Installation

3. Run `VSCarbon: Show Carbon` to start monitoring
4. Check the status bar for current carbon intensity, click on it for dashboard showing electricity mix and sustainable commit stats

## Commands

- `VSCarbon: Show Carbon` - Start monitoring carbon intensity
- `VSCarbon: Set Postcode` - Configure your UK postcode for regional carbon intensity data
- `VSCarbon: Reset Commit Stats` - Clear commit stats

## Requirements

- Internet connection for fetching live grid data
- UK postcode for regional carbon intensity data

## Known Issues
