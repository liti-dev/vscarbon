# VSCarbon

Encourage low-carbon coding habits with real-time electricity grid data! VSCarbon shows you when the electricity grid has lower carbon intensity, helping you time energy-intensive tasks.

**Make your coding greener, one commit at a time! ðŸŒ±**

## Features

âœ… **Real-time Carbon Intensity**: Status bar displays current carbon intensity from the UK electricity grid  
âœ… **Location-based Data**: Enter your UK postcode for regional carbon intensity data  
âœ… **Visual Indicators**: Emoji changes based on carbon levels (ðŸ˜¸ for low, ðŸ˜¿ for high)  
âœ… **Electricity Mix Breakdown**: Click status bar to see detailed grid composition  
ðŸ”„ **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 minutes to keep data current  

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from .vsix (Try it now!)
1. Download the latest `vscarbon-0.1.0.vsix` from [Releases](https://github.com/liti-dev/vscarbon/releases)
