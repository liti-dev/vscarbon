## Features

‚úÖ **Real-time Carbon Intensity**: Status bar displays current carbon intensity from the UK electricity grid  
‚úÖ **Location-based Data**: Enter your UK postcode for regional carbon intensity data  
‚úÖ **Visual Indicators**: Emoji changes based on carbon levels (üò∏ for low, üòø for high)  
‚úÖ **Commit Tracker**: Count sustainable git commits  
‚úÖ **Dashboard**: Click status bar to see detailed grid mix and commit stats  
üîÑ **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 minutes to keep data current

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from .vsix (Try it now!)

1. Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/liti-dev/vscarbon/releases)
2. In VS Code: Go to Extension -> More actions -> Install from VSIX, or `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
3. Select the downloaded .vsix file

### Option 2: VS Code Marketplace (Coming soon!)

## Getting Started

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run `VSCarbon: Set Postcode` and enter your UK outward postcode (e.g., "SW1A", "M1", "AL10")
3. Run `VSCarbon: Show Carbon` to start monitoring
4. Check the status bar for current carbon intensity, click on it for dashboard showing electricity mix and sustainable commit stats

## Commands

- `VSCarbon: Show Carbon` - Start monitoring carbon intensity
- `VSCarbon: Set Postcode` - Configure your UK postcode for regional carbon intensity data
- `VSCarbon: Reset Commit Stats` - Clear commit stats

## Requirements

- Internet connection for fetching live grid data
- UK postcode for regional carbon intensity data

## Known Issues
