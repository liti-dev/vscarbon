# VSCarbon

Encourage low-carbon coding habits with real-time electricity grid data! VSCarbon shows you when the electricity grid has lower carbon intensity, helping you time energy-intensive tasks.

**Make your coding greener, one commit at a time! üå±**

## Features

‚úÖ **Real-time Carbon Intensity**: Status bar displays current carbon intensity from the UK electricity grid  
‚úÖ **Location-based Data**: Enter your UK outward postcode or [country code for users outside UK](https://portal.electricitymaps.com/developer-hub/api/getting-started#geographical-coverage) for local carbon intensity data  
‚úÖ **Visual Indicators**: Emoji changes based on carbon levels (üò∏ for low, üòø for high)  
‚úÖ **Commit Tracker**: Track sustainable git commits locally  
‚úÖ **Dashboard**: Click status bar to see detailed grid mix and commit stats  
üîÑ **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 30 minutes to keep data current

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from .vsix (Try it now!)

1. Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/liti-dev/vscarbon/releases)
2. In VS Code: Go to Extension -> More actions -> Install from VSIX, or `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Extensions: Install from VSIX..."
3. Select the downloaded .vsix file

### Option 2: VS Code Marketplace (Coming soon!)

## Getting Started
### For UK users
1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run `VSCarbon: Set Postcode/Country Code` and enter your UK OUTWARD postcode (e.g., SW1A, M1, AL10)
3. Run `VSCarbon: Show Carbon` to start monitoring
4. Check the status bar for current carbon intensity, click on it for dashboard showing electricity mix and sustainable commit stats
### For users outside UK
1. Register your [Electricity Maps API key](https://portal.electricitymaps.com/auth/login). Free tier allows only 1 country so please choose carefully
2. Run `VSCarbon: Configure API Key` command to input your key
3. Run `VSCarbon: Set Postcode/Country Code` and enter country code (e.g., AT, DE, ES)
3. Run `VSCarbon: Show Carbon` to start monitoring
4. Check the status bar for current carbon intensity, click on it for dashboard showing electricity mix and sustainable commit stats

## Commands

- `VSCarbon: Configure API Key` - Input Electricity Maps API key for users outside UK
- `VSCarbon: Set Postcode/Country Code` - Configure your location
- `VSCarbon: Show Carbon` - Start monitoring carbon intensity
- `VSCarbon: Reset Commit Stats` - Clear commit stats

## Known Issues

- Currently supports UK regional data and country-level data for the other countries
- Requires internet connection for updating data

## Data Source

- UK data is provided by [Carbon Intensity API](https://carbonintensity.org.uk/) - National Grid ESO
- [Electricity Maps](https://portal.electricitymaps.com/developer-hub/api/getting-started#geographical-coverage) for the other countries

## Changelog

### v1.0.0
- Expanded country coverage beyond the UK (country list [here](https://portal.electricitymaps.com/developer-hub/api/getting-started#geographical-coverage)) thanks to Electricity Maps API

### v0.2.1 (Bug Fix)
- üêõ **Fixed commit tracking accuracy**: Commit tracker now only counts actual `git commit` commands, not file changes or staging
- üîß **Improved detection method**: Switched from VS Code Git API monitoring to Git log file watching for more reliable commit detection
- ‚ú® **Enhanced test function**: Better error messages and validation in commit tracking test

### v0.2.0
- ‚ú® Added commit tracking functionality
- üìä Commit statistics dashboard
- üå± Sustainable commit notifications
